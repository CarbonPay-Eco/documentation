# üß± Database Schema ‚Äì CarbonPay

This document describes the off-chain database structure of the CarbonPay platform. The system uses **wallet-based authentication only** (no username/password), and all core entities are tied to connected Solana wallets. Each certified carbon offset project is tokenized as a **single SPL token**, so **each project = one token**.
